# Evapotranspiration Data Integration Need
Evapotranspiration measures the water needs of landscapes and forms a critical data point in Governor Brown's new long term framework for water conservation.  This data is measured statewide in geospatially sparse in situ sensor networks and interpolating that data across California requires wind, precipitation, solar radiation and other publicly available data.  Those data sources however are fragmented and integrating those together along with the appropriate scientific methodology can help improve this important measurement for the people of California.

# Raw Data Sources to be Integrated
1. [Precipitation from CDEC](http://cdec.water.ca.gov/misc/RealPrecip.html)
2. Temperature
3. Wind
4. Land Cover (NAIP)
5. Physiography

# Gridded ET
1. [Forecasted ET from NOAA](http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/forecast/evap/FRET/FRET.php?wfo=sto)
2. [See here for technical documentation on the NOAA forecasted ET gridded data](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://ndfd.weather.gov/technical.htm&sa=D&ust=1483383177762000&usg=AFQjCNGG3mUFtYLThq6PzvMVS0Bui8tNlA)
